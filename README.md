# Project1

Do you have a lot of random food in your cupboard or refrigerator and not know what to make for breakfast, lunch, or dinner?

Well look no further! Meal planning ideas are just a click away with our application, Food for You!

Enter in the ingredients that you have in your fridge and click on the "Recipes" tab. The system will generate a list of recipes that includes the ingredients you have inputed in. At the bottom of each recipe, there is a "View Recipe" button, where a module will pop up and give you the choice of saving that specific recipe. When you save a recipe, it will be saved in "My Favorites" tab, so that you can keep the recipes you like. If you change your mind, you can remove the saved recipe in "My Favorites" tab at the bottom of the recipe. 

Not feeling like cooking, then head over to our "Restaurant" tab and watch local restaurants populate the page! In addition, you can view the menu of each restaurant to see if you want to eat there or not. 

If you would like to know more about the developers of Food for You, check out our "About Us" tab!

Now, you will never be stuck on planning a meal again!
